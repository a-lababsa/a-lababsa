**Software Craftsman Padawan**

> *“I am and will remain a craftsman all my life.”* - Charles Aznavour

Developer passionate about technical excellence. As I discover Software Craftsmanship, I learn the fundamentals of quality code every day through practice and experimentation.  

My goal: **to gradually develop my skills and craftsmanship mindset**.

## Philosophy

I deeply believe that **software development is a craft**. Like any other craft. As an apprentice craftsman, I focus on **the fundamentals above all else**.

### Learning
    - SOLID principles and Clean Code
    - Practicing refactoring to improve existing code
    - Exploring architectural patterns (DDD, Hexagonal Architecture)
    - Discovering advanced testing practices (TDD, Testing Pyramid)

### Practice
    - Regular exercises on Codewars to develop my logic
    - Code reviews to learn from experienced developers
    - Experimentation on personal projects to understand concepts
    - Gradual improvement of my code's readability

### Share
    - Participate in meetups to discover practices (e.g., Coding Dojo)
    - Be mentored by experienced craftsmen
    - Share my discoveries as an apprentice with other beginners
